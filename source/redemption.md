## Immediate Actions

* Make sure parking area for Redemption is clear of vehicles.

* If vehicles are blocking area, ask if any of them are CERT members working in the ARK area and ask them to move their cars to another designated area.

* If vehicles cannot be moved, use your judgment on how and where to set up Redemption area.

* Designate parking spaces for signage for supplies coming in, make signs-

  * Possible signage: Baby Items, Clothing, Food, Water, etc.

## Continuing Actions

* Keep driveway open for drop off/pick up of material using cones, yellow tape and/or barricades.

* Keep dropped off material organized.

* Advise Logistics Lead if you need assistance.

* Advise Logistics Lead that you have donated items in case the Town of Los Altos Hills needs them.

* If you need a break, contact Logistics Lead for relief.

* Volunteers that report to you will also need to be rotated in and out; develop a plan for this to happen.

* **Refer all inquiries about the incident to the Town EOC PIO.**

* **When there is a shift change, turn all Redemption Team materials over to your replacement AND provide them with any information they will need to successfully perform their duties.**

* During demobilization, ensure all copies of forms \(items received and items distributed\) are turned over to the Demobilization team so the documents can be filed in the ARK for documentation purposes and future use by Finance.

* Replace your vest and supply items in the CERT Redemption Team zip lock bag, place the bag and return the bag to the Demobilization Team. **REPLENISH ALL ITEMS \(SUPPLIES, FORMS, ETC.\) FROM THE ARK SUPPLIES TO ENSURE THE REDEMPTION TEAM ZIP LOCK BAG CAN IMMEDIATELY BE USED FOR ANOTHER INCIDENT, IF NECESSARY.**
