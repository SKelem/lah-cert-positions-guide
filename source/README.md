# Los Altos CERT Position Guide

This book documents all the standard roles and responsibilities for the Los Altos Hills \(LAH\) Community Emergency Response Team \(CERT\)

We use the Incident Command System \(ICS\) to describe our organization during an incident.

We plan for this organization structure:

* Incident Commander
  * Operations Lead
    * Recon Lead
    * Communications
    * Medical
  * Planning Lead
    * Scribe
    * IT Team
    * Demobilization
  * Logistics Lead
    * Staging
    * Check-in
    * Redemption
    * Spontaneous Volunteer

We do not staff an ICS Finance position.

The positions are logical responsibilities.  Not all positions will have assigned personnel.  Any position that is not assigned belongs to the Incident Commander until it is delegated.
