This is the source repository for the Los Altos Hills CERT (Community Emergency Response Team)'s position guide.

The Position guide describes all the pre-defined positions we might use during an incident.

The guide is published at [our website](https://cert.lahcfd.org/procedures-and-documentation).

We use [readthedocs.io](https://readthedocs.ior) to compile and rebuild the documentation.  The url is [https://lah-cert-positions-guide.readthedocs.io/](https://lah-cert-positions-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
